# JupyterLocSpecifier
a very simple application to open jupyter notebook directly after choosing the direction instead of using the cd command and then using the jupyter notebook command in the terminal.


you can convert this applciation to a bat file instead of running it with python and the path to the file by adding a new text file and then converting it into a .bat instead of .txt and then you can add the script that is in the ConvertToBatFile.txt and then adding the correct path to the python code and then save the bat file.
